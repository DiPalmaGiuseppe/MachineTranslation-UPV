These answers were quite correct: it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue. However, it is also true that it is absolutely inexcusable to provide a globalised and harmonised response.\\nThose people who are somewhat detached from terrorism are more concerned about individual guarantees. My concern is for both individual and collective guarantees. It is absolutely vital that we start where we can. If we have to start with air transport, given that air carriers already have this data, then that is where we must start.\\nWe will demand guarantees, we will assess the scope and we will start with international transport.

       "1  Mr President, Commissioner, terrorism and serious organised crime are global phenomena. The means for fighting these must therefore be proportional and effective.\\nI took due note of the answers given to the questions. These answers were quite correct: it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue. However, it is also true that it is absolutely inexcusable to provide a globalised and harmonised response.\\nThose people who are somewhat detached from terrorism are more concerned about individual guarantees. My concern is for both individual and collective guarantees. It is absolutely vital that we start where we can. If we have to start with air transport, given that air carriers already have this data, then that is where we must start.\\nWe will demand guarantees, we will assess the scope and we will start with international transport. However, it should be noted that we will then move on to domestic transport because terrorists very often do not come from outside, but are home-grown. Ask the United States and everyone else, because that is how it is and that is how we will have to address it in the future.   \n",

       "1  mr president commissioner terrorism and serious organised crime are global phenomena the means for fighting these must therefore be proportional and effective i took due note of the answers given to the questions these answers were quite correct it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue however it is also true that it is absolutely inexcusable to provide a globalised and harmonised response those people who are somewhat detached from terrorism are more concerned about individual guarantees my concern is for both individual and collective guarantees it is absolutely vital that we start where we can if we have to start with air transport given that air carriers already have this data then that is where we must start we will demand guarantees we will assess the scope and we will start with international transport however it should be noted that we will then move on to domestic transport because terrorists very often do not come from outside but are home grown ask the united states and everyone else because that is how it is and that is how we will have to address it in the future    \n",
